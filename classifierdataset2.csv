record fails to lift lacklustre meet  yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham  and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record  apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets  so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish  it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon  who has run  seconds  will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet  something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national m race in a new personal best of  seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly , sports

time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the  minutes at the end  i would say its  whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first  minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you englands game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember svengoran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed , sports

kennedy looks to election gains  they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics  the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected  election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow  as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson  that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than  a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats  labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name , politics

campaign cold calls questioned  labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls  the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing  for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election  but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications  the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service  he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue  earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them , politics

will tory tax cuts lift spirits  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts  should he win the next general election he has earmarked  billion that will be used to reduce taxes  although he still will not say which or how this was the preelection message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its  billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that  billion would go on spending plans with  billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eyecatching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts  the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard  can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy  one of new labours greatest successes before the historic  election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely  and the prime minister probably hopes  that the economy will be the deciding factor , politics

labours election lovein  peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days  if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each others throats over the contents of labours next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labours latest poster campaign the event  at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames  was a carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years  the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when  in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions  labours speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mindbending of psychedelic messages  lowest mortgage rate for  years as the sidedoor slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doostyle but sadly it wasnt the cabinet who had raided the dressingup box  just six rather illatease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies  to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for  years another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the s  the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies  the politicians  led out by john prescott  were soberlysuited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labours economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked sidebyside with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months  the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labours shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellors record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from  claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stagemanaged to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn  but keen students of body language will have had a field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretarys final gesture placing an arm on mr browns back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying , politics

look out of place in any home apple computers are famously user friendly and offer much better network security which means fewer viruses the package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy  the mac mini is just a box if you dont already have a monitor etc adding them to the package sees the value for money begin to dwindle macs dont offer the upgrade flexibility of a

is the upgrade path interest has switched from processor power to graphics and sound cards as thats what makes the difference in games even manufacturers are not going to be marketing machines as faster he said theyll emphasise the different features    a computer built from bits you buy and put together yourself  a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp  processor  megabytes ram a graphics card with  ram on board plus tv out a  gb hard drive cdwriter and dvd player windows xp home  anything else youre building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own troubleshooting and tech support building your own machine is easier than it used to be but you need to read specifications carefully to make sure all parts work together  experienced and keen pc users building your own pc or upgrading the one you have is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works  its cheap you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should  once its built you wont be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it if it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing as gavin cox of the excellent buildyourownorguk website put it it will be tough to obtainbuild a pc to ever be as compact and charming as the mac mini

antitremor mouse stops pc shakes  a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed  the device uses similar steady cam technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition said the uk national tremor foundation using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so were delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem said karen walsh from the uk national tremor foundation most commonly associated with tremors is parkinsons disease but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor et tremors more often affect older people but can hit all ages et for example is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives  the assistive mouse adapter ama is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle who has parkinsons disease struggle with mouse control i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world including the elderly  the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages and at the same time the need for computer access grows he said computer users plug the device into a pc and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits ibm said it would partner up with a small ukbased electronics firm montrose secam to produce the devices which will cost about  james cosgrave one of the companys directors said it would make a big difference to those with tremors im a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane he said but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life  the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier last year the office for national statistics reported that for the first time more than half of all households in britain had a home computer with prices getting cheaper to get online too computer ownership is increasing but although  of british people have tried the internet only  of britons aged  or over have been online more than six million uk households now have a broadband net by the middle of  it is estimated that  of all uk net users will be on broadband there are still millions using the net through dialup connections too , technology

digital guru floats sub pc  nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mits media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than    he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries he said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel  the second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in  mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on  while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in  laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make  million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make  million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of  and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend  per child per year on textbooks thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away , technology
pompeii gets digital makeover  the oldfashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computergenerated images that bring the site to life  a european unionfunded project is looking at providing tourists with computeraugmented versions of archaeological attractions it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism  the technology would allow digital people and other computergenerated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site  the lifeplus project is part of the eus information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting userfriendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage engineers and researchers working in the europewide consortium have come up with a prototype augmentedreality system it would require the visitor to wear a headmounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitors viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements at pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming  this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games said professor nadia magnenatthalman of the swiss research group miralab  we are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in realtime she said unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computergenerated scene to the viewer the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitors view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company d andrew stoddart chief scientist at d said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computergenerated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life he said , technology

kenyan school turns to handhelds  at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus  they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get uptodate information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the nongovernmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called eslates the eslates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld eslates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc  the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project its very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but its also a oneway connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult  the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linuxbased system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the worlds largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like  million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the eslates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the eslates says the projects ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting  as they need it most , technology

a question of trust and technology  a major government department is without email for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened  a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uks department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of email and access to the application software they use to calculate peoples benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done fortunately the backoffice systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans  although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows  to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network  this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved todays computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems it is the network equivalent of godels theorem  any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press  it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio s today programme throughout friday morning  so why did not the prime ministers official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaires disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently anything less is a betrayal of public trust  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital , technology

nintendo ds aims to touch gamers  the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in  with a number of highprofile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mouldbreaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a s handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firms preeminence in an increasinglycompetitive mobile gaming market  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in  and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while startup companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in midnovember priced  and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of  to get the device with more than two million preorders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters  a d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a topdown map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario  ds is a faithful recreation of the nintendo  classic with a host of new minigames and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo dss key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks , technology

lifestyle governs mobile choice  faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests  instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an indepth study by handset maker ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericssons consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website  for the study ericsson interviewed  mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone peoples habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it  one good example of this was diarywriting among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone  especially one equipped with a camera  helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericssons research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about  of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it  once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now  of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in  the figure was  similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in  only  of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is  similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life , technology

new consoles promise big problems  making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told  sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e games expo in los angeles in may these socalled next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higherquality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a prerecorded video slot during microsofts keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film  believed to be battle angel alita the games visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsofts xbox  is not expected to reach the shops until the end of  games typically take at least  months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today  according to robert walsh head of brisbanebased game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between m to make with teams averaging  staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if youre a startup i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for m however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games  one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the bestselling the sims games the founder of californias maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoebasized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve  eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i dont want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins  i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright id like to offer an alternative to that  new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference  oxfordbased natural motion launched endorphin v which enables artists to direct a d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester startup genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photorealistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an inbuilt supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to  new heads an hour  one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices  the game developers conference included a special twoday summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdcs mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fastgrowing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world its predicted that by  two billion people will own a mobile phone the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected

court mulls filesharing future  judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against filesharing networks  the court will decide whether producers of filesharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue filesharers could deter innovation they also said that filetrading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy  the lawsuit brought by  of the worlds largest entertainment firms has raged for several years legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue filetrading firms into bankruptcy but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus  the filesharers at the centre of the case  are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of filesharing providers instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peertopeer networks to get their hands on free music and movies the hitech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the filesharing community it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes  asking firms to secondguess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said the electronic frontier foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending streamcast networks the company behind the morpheus filesharing software the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said it cites as do many the landmark ruling in  which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peertopeer networks upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing save betamax tshirts the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past  years said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer electronics association supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apples ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society he said that while filetrading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses  based on tuesdays hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but filesharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy groksters lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up but this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by justice david souter cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year its about preserving americas proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peertopeer networks they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs filesharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music , technology

gritty return for prince of persia  still basking in the relatively recent glory of last years sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time  this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the superathletic prince from a thirdperson perspective the timetravelling plot hinges on the dahaka an allconsuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beasts creation  studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to oldfashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series thengroundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulouslyanimated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts  those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the games developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off  warrior within is a very slick package the games intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences  it is on a par with the jawdropping opening sequence of onimusha  earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anticlimax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect  a meritfree heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for ,movie

podcasters look to net money  nasa is doing it yearold boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers  male and female  are definitely doing it  it is podcasting  diy radio in the form of downloadable mp audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement textbased weblogs  diarylike sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages its about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator  it collects and automatically sends mp files to any digital musicplaying device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe  for free  to that shows feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation  like my daughter who is   who dont listen to radio they are on msn theyve got their ipod their mp player theyve got their xbox  they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it  it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says  podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about  a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the timeshifting of content  the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the s s and s rather than millions more than  podcasts are currently listed currys daily source code  which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community  has s of thousands of listeners  but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longestrunning weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its overhyped business promise  were the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what were doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isnt going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like email or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron blooms new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are readymade targets when you look at podcasting  wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is preselected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have    listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional inyourface type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place  it is happening already coffeeloving curry has sold  worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site  others use inshow promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money ,music

artists to watch published at the start of last year scissor sisters franz ferdinand keane joss stone and mcfly were all in the sound of  top  the other five brits winners were already established before sound of  was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv on thursday    im speechless best song of the last  years yeah right  i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before  give us a break  best song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really  listened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection  as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low  im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  years  what about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbish  angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music  best of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after all  its alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  years  there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travesty  rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear from  while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show  youve got to be kidding  angels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits  i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself though  best song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will young  oh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent  i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance with  i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie  i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush  angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups  robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think  yes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning  ive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss  angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century  no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come on  what a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come close  what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of   people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here  the great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope  no because im not female and im not   ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a joke  predictable and laughable  the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  years  i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list  have radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever will  no doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song  it should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today  yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner  i am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music  the best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down  it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  lt  no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin  i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it  if this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record  a sad day for music  its not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbie  best song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become  granted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for him  best song of the last  year,music
s what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful  angels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners  it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob  i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular  ive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit  no surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music  personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard  it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come  its an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise   the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young though  although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent  although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means ,music

dance music not dead says fatboy  dj norman cook  aka fatboy slim  has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch  the commercial failure of the latest albums by britains two biggest dance acts  fatboy slims palookaville and the prodigys always outnumbered never outgunned  has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where its happening in music these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music  and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world services the ticket programme i personally dont believe its either dead or going to die but its going through a bit of a fallow patch so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track then  although his album sales in the uk are down  palookaville stayed in the uk top  for just three weeks  cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties and event on brighton sea front in  attracted  people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of  the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year  with a crowd that big if the weathers nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think ive got them cook said im always really really nervous before the big ones  they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor for some reason especially now ive got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre thats already going on means all i have to do is play up records he promised more such parties in more locations around the world  despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party were having to widen our horizons from just beaches because theres landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said were doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo  our new gig is famous football stadiums  the dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary breakup of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppe  the tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said especially the meandzoegate  its quite scary he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldnt think i was depressed he explained then i thought thats not right and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence  that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if its on the album he recalled she said yeah its hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on  where paul mccartney is a neighbour its almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained if theres a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each others doors  paul comes round and we warn him because we dont know who theyre after ,music

how the academy awards flourished  the th annual academy awards are taking place on  february with the stars of the moviemaking world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year but from humble beginnings how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today  how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in  at a comparatively lowkey dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel  just over the road from their modern day home  just  guests attended with ticket prices at   the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award for the first  years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at pm but in  the winners were published in the los angeles times at pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspensefilled night that happens today when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until  but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner  the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous graumans chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in  just across the road from its original home and holds  people until  they were held on a thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february the first televised ceremony was in  with bob hope as the mc who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar  one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article  the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburns first best actress win in  the academy officially adopted the nickname in  the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons since its inception  oscars have been handed out in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing fiftyfive statues were stolen in en route to the awards in   were recovered nine days later winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out who sits in judgement the academy was set up in  as a nonprofit organisation with  members from different film disciplines douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards there are now  members of the academy  with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers some of the criteria for admittance includes film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film the stars who left emptyhanded while many of the biggest films and moviemakers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics  among the overlooked films were hobsons choice dirty harry the  steps the searchers and king kong actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer  humphrey bogart in casablanca  gene kelly in singing in the rain  and henry fonda in  angry men  alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in  the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event there were calls for it to be cancelled in  during the war in iraq but as it didnt stop during world war ii or the vietnam war  documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions los angeles floods in  saw it put back a week the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in  as a mark of respect and there was a hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan

substance could impair  keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it theres no way i could limit the hours id spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england  but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stantondavies in huddersfield scaremongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices  gaming is like any other pastime  it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry  unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending  to  hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some  massively multiplayer online role playing games  mmorpgs  allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games  like warcraft everquest ultima among others  is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding  by which gamers have to perform longwinded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such openendedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online roleplaying game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably  to  hours a week on average and on weeks where i didnt have to work as many as  or  hours  he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasnt that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you dont go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest  let us be clear  such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost  people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heartrending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent  all are anonymous  wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me  i cant talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesnt hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question  gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent  hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems    i wish  hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isnt an  hour stretch isnt that surprising  ive known people to play  hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their weeks holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play evercrack in shiftswaking at am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting  sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over  years  since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time  i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over  hours a week but i dont go missing work or other commitments in order to play games  i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst  the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing youre at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your  hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since youve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one  despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality  my advice to gaming widows is if you cant beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least youll be together somewhere  i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt  hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate  obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than  for example  an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed  the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern  hour culture  the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them theres always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about  hours sleep since it was released friday  championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another  hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that  i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague  when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from am till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job  when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on there its not easy i feel as if ive got a real addiction going on here  for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times  in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it  i cant buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it  i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level im sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for   which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum  seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated  years of my life they were  wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv  gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun  online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates  many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming  sounds like there are some sad stories here  and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it  i think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest  and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that id rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united  i am obsessed with online role playing games its not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation  goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature  these games are like most things  too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun  living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games  i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a  hour straight session i know i play for to long but its an obsession that i cant control can you reccomend a counsellor  this is not a wind up but something im increasingly concerned with  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day were both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual its getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life  i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was  hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldnt help myself in future im going to regulate my time far more strictly great game  having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into  unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a persons health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse  these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless  hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term,game
d metal slug offers retro fun  like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug  is a wakeup call to todays gamers mollycoddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings  with its handanimated sprites and d sidescrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year and yes that includes halo  simply choose your grunt and wade through five d sidescrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on  players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screenfilling bosses that guard each of the five levels  the shootanythingthatmoves gameplay is peppered with moments of oldschool genius fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannontoting camels elephants and ostriches  more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go and at a mere  metal slug  is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug  is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye ,game

big war games battle it out  the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the originals elements for its part the longrunning medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war  battlefronts including russia and north africa it is a traditional firstpersonviewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on a nearidentical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tightknit team and plum in the middle of allout action its arenas are the wars pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier  both games rely on a carefully stagemanaged structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it does not it is tedious  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the antiaircraft guns it is one of the finest setpieces ever seen in a video game this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously predetermined path forcibly witnessing a series of preset moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life  is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a fullon atmospheric experience  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voiceovers  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the games drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a topend computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plotwise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready targeting with the ps controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collisiondetection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like autosaving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a highspec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent ,game

nintendo ds aims to touch gamers  the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in  with a number of highprofile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mouldbreaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a s handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firms preeminence in an increasinglycompetitive mobile gaming market  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in  and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while startup companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in midnovember priced  and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of  to get the device with more than two million preorders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters  a d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a topdown map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario  ds is a faithful recreation of the nintendo  classic with a host of new minigames and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo dss key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks ,game

new consoles promise big problems  making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told  sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e games expo in los angeles in may these socalled next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higherquality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a prerecorded video slot during microsofts keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film  believed to be battle angel alita the games visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsofts xbox  is not expected to reach the shops until the end of  games typically take at least  months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today  according to robert walsh head of brisbanebased game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between m to make with teams averaging  staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if youre a startup i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for m however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games  one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the bestselling the sims games the founder of californias maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoebasized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve  eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i dont want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins  i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright id like to offer an alternative to that  new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference  oxfordbased natural motion launched endorphin v which enables artists to direct a d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester startup genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photorealistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an inbuilt supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to  new heads an hour  one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices  the game developers conference included a special twoday summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdcs mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fastgrowing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world its predicted that by  two billion people will own a mobile phone the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter general manager at ea mobile ea mobile is a division of electronic arts the biggest games publisher until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones the last time you checked ea wasnt in this business mr batter admitted but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises ea plans to release up to  mobile games over the next  months the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game created by ea mobiles person development team mr batter predicted that by  mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sonys upcoming psp handheld console  owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine ,game
the force is strong in battlefront  the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its backtobasics approach and immense nostalgia quotient  geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of allout gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves  the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or firstperson perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil  there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a firedup luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical atats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedis muchmaligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation  the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of largescale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over  speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxys audio motifs  the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bogstandard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the games insistence on respawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non userfriendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the aboveaverage ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty onetrickpony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable ,game

gritty return for prince of persia  still basking in the relatively recent glory of last years sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time  this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the superathletic prince from a thirdperson perspective the timetravelling plot hinges on the dahaka an allconsuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beasts creation  studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to oldfashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series thengroundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulouslyanimated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts  those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the games developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off  warrior within is a very slick package the games intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences  it is on a par with the jawdropping opening sequence of onimusha  earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anticlimax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect  a meritfree heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for ,game

losing yourself in online gaming  online role playing games are timeconsuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously  when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight  and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair  keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it theres no way i could limit the hours id spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england  but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stantondavies in huddersfield scaremongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices  gaming is like any other pastime  it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry  unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending  to  hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some  massively multiplayer online role playing games  mmorpgs  allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games  like warcraft everquest ultima among others  is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding  by which gamers have to perform longwinded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such openendedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online roleplaying game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably  to  hours a week on average and on weeks where i didnt have to work as many as  or  hours  he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasnt that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you dont go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest  let us be clear  such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost  people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heartrending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent  all are anonymous  wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me  i cant talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesnt hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question  gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent  hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems    i wish  hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isnt an  hour stretch isnt that surprising  ive known people to play  hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their weeks holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play evercrack in shiftswaking at am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting  sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over  years  since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time  i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over  hours a week but i dont go missing work or other commitments in order to play games  i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst  the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing youre at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your  hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since youve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one  despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality  my advice to gaming widows is if you cant beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least youll be together somewhere  i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt  hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate  obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than  for example  an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed  the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern  hour culture  the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them theres always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about  hours sleep since it was released friday  championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another  hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that  i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague  when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from am till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job  when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on there its not easy i feel as if ive got a real addiction going on here  for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times  in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it  i cant buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it  i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level im sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for   which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum  seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated  years of my life they were  wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv  gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun  online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates  many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming  sounds like there are some sad stories here  and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it  i think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest  and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that id rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united  i am obsessed with online role playing games its not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation  goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature  these games are like most things  too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun  living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games  i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a  hour straight session i know i play for to long but its an obsession that i cant control can you reccomend a counsellor  this is not a wind up but something im increasingly concerned with  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day were both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual its getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life  i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was  hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldnt help myself in future im going to regulate my time far more strictly great game  having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into  unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a persons health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse  these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless  hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term,game
games enter the classroom  video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom  with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error  futurelab is a nonprofit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpoolbased games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market learning games were somewhat oldfashioned and we didnt see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well  it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen  the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the childrens desire to rise to a challenge games in the classroom need to support the teacher it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms  use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used socalled edutainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles  persuading developers to write for the educational market this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though ,game

bond game fails to shake or stir  for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of  but also the classic shootemup that accompanied it and left n owners glued to their consoles for many an hour  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the originals massive sense of fun this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond worlds extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi your new commanderinchief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in  but happily running around bent on world domination with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turners similarlytitled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of xray vision  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a  game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo  and half life  triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collisiondetection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game makers allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights  no time is risked with a measured buildup  by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hatfiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion  there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash but the ingame niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thoughtthrough will make this a disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again  fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bonds healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return  goldeneye rogue agent is out now ,game
games deserve a place in class  computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers  academics from the institute of education at london university found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say pupils should also be able to create their own games they say  like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young peoples lives said project manager caroline pelletier  games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing she said the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning researchers found that girls were often excluded from the maledominated world of game playing without firsthand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity said research fellow diane carr  the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them sixthform teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film tv and popular music at the alevel course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge  for parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy dr andrew burn associate director of the institute of educations centre for the study of children youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do he said but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games the games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently said roger bennett director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association this report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming they have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career the threeyear research project which is being presented at a seminar on tuesday in london was partly funded by the department of trade and industry ,game
gta sequel is criminally good  the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition  the  certificate gta san andreas for the playstation  could have got away with merely revisiting a bestselling formula with a moreofthesame approach instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the drivr and true crimeshaped opposition even in the year that will see sequels to halo and halflife it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic  the basic gameplay remains familiar you control a character on this occasion a youth named cj who sets out on a series of selfcontained missions within a massive d environment cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a pushbike to a city bus to a plane all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities los santos which is a thinlydisguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas a carbon copy of las vegas san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing  its ability to capture the ambience of the realworld versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the games overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous the outstanding breadandbutter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and theres more traffic to navigate than before park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pileup pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in minigames like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of overeating and at last this is a gta hero who can swim  at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the procensorship brigade developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings  when hijacking a car for example cj will gratuitously shove the drivers head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy s setting of the last game this title incidentally is set in  but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings a further reason for this is that the incredible range of invehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games trademark humour is anchored the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply offthechart the games rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed it is a testament to san andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but pluspoints are so numerous that the niggles dont detract the onscreen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions there is also a very jarring slowdown at actionpacked moments and the game suffers from the ageold problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings san andreas is among the few unmissable games of  ,game

big war games battle it out  the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the originals elements for its part the longrunning medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war  battlefronts including russia and north africa it is a traditional firstpersonviewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on a nearidentical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tightknit team and plum in the middle of allout action its arenas are the wars pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier  both games rely on a carefully stagemanaged structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it does not it is tedious  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the antiaircraft guns it is one of the finest setpieces ever seen in a video game this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously predetermined path forcibly witnessing a series of preset moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life  is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a fullon atmospheric experience  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voiceovers  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the games drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a topend computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plotwise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready targeting with the ps controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collisiondetection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like autosaving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a highspec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent ,game

mobile games come of age  the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief roundup follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below part two will follow on monday  reviews of call of duty splinter cell  pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokias ngage game phone launched in late  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset  and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than  different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles  there are shootemups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tiein increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost  what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available  even the ones that use d graphics  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth shortrange radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing  too fast too furious digital bridges  as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games  because im rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play  fatal force macrospace  a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoonlike but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right powerup you can go into a matrixstyle bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps ,game

online games play with politics  after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in   the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of  the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean more than  followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media others helped raise the stakes during the bushkerry contest by highlighting a candidates virtues or his vices  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multidiscipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers  when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayanborn researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgamingcom the aim is to comment on international news events via games  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way  video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the countrys problems could be solved by working together its up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs children learn a lot about the world through play there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up  but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns  this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a musthave dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns ,game

the force is strong in battlefront  the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its backtobasics approach and immense nostalgia quotient  geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of allout gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves  the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or firstperson perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil  there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a firedup luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical atats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedis muchmaligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation  the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of largescale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over  speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxys audio motifs  the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bogstandard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the games insistence on respawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non userfriendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the aboveaverage ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty onetrickpony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable ,game
football manager scores big time  for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs  however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise si kept the games code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected at this point cm looks like it will ship early next year but given that football manager  is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up  a game like fm could blind you with statistics it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans but that does not do justice to the game really what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth  you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovichs millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan  the list goes on a very long way once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champions or else obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it then bring on the matches which are once more available in the everimproving top down d view with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed  however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well  things like the manager mindgames which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience  with a game that is so complex and so openended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybodys satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there are many more tweaks and improvements if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm might make you forget there was anything else before it if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm could be the best purchase you ever made just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas  football manager  out now for the pc and the mac ,game

gsk aims to stop aids profiteers  one of the worlds largest manufacturers of hivaids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills  supplied to poorer african countries  back into europe for resale at far higher price  the company glaxosmithkline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies they want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap antiaids drugs to the worlds poorest nations  the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hivpositive africans through their governments health care systems  but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and reselling them at a higher price glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have resold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade glaxo says distribution of the newlook drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe , business

why few targets are better than many  the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in  were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the worlds leading economy by   but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesnt become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states thats why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed  lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an option  at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europes competitive position is waning the eus economic growth rate is projected to be  this year and  next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years  as mr koks report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit  the circumstances werent conducive to creating the  million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in  neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a socalled knowledgebased economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brusselsbased citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you theyre in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity  but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised  lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one thats why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to  key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps theyre taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery dont necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we dont have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another  on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth its very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brusselsbased thinktank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do its going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report doesnt come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it doesnt say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr koks recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eus competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his fiveyear term in office to be judged on europes success in meeting the lisbon agenda , business
